                    <h3>HISTORY OF THE COLOR BROWN</h3>
                    
                <p>
                    Brown is one of the first colors humans used in art. Scientists have found cave paintings, made with a clay pigment called umber, dating back to 40,000 BC.
The ancient Egyptians used umber to depict skin. The ancient Greeks used this pigment to paint amphorae and vases.
Umber wasn't the only pigment that the ancient Greeks used. They, and the ancient Romans, developed sepia, a reddish-brown ink taken from a variety of cuttlefish. 
The Romans associated brown with the lower classes or barbarians. Their term for the urban poor came from the word pullati which literally means "those dressed in brown".
In the Middle Ages, poor English people were required to wear russet, a coarse homespun cloth made of wool and dyed with woad and madder which gave it a muted grey or brown shade. Painters rarely used brown during this period as they preferred brighter colors like red, blue, and green.
Brown only became popular among painters when the Renaissance came. Artists of this time used four types of brown: raw umber, the dark brown clay mined around Umbria, in Italy, raw sienna, a reddish-brown earth mined near Siena, in Tuscany; burnt umber, the Umbrian clay heated until it turned a darker shade, and burnt sienna, earth heated until it turned a dark reddish-brown.

                        Burnt umber is a strong reddish brown. It's produced by heating raw umber, dehydrating its iron oxide content, and changing it into reddish hematite.
